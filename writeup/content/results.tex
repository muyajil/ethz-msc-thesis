\chapter{Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item bring everything together
\item compare best performing model to automl from google
\item Here we need the best performing models of each experiment
\item The long tail is the problem -> histogram of visits per user/product
\item Show PCA of user embeddings and product embeddings
\item Future Work: Improving product embeddings by using content2vec, improving recommendations by using transfer learning, specializing a model on the top 20\% of users and unpersonalized models for the bottom 80\%, train the session based model on all sessions, not only the ones we know the userIds of.
