  This work examines how a session-based recommendation system can be combined with pre-trained item embeddings.
  Session-based recommendation systems are highly relevant in online services such as music or video streaming services and e-commerce, more and more so when the item catalogs grow into the millions.
  The approach presented in this work is tested in a production setting with live users, using a industry dataset magnitudes larger than the datasets used in works this thesis is based on.
  We show that session-recommendation performs better than classical recommendation approaches, however the combination of the two approaches was unsuccessful, failing primarily because of the Long Tail phenomenon.
