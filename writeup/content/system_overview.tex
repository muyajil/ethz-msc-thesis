\chapter{System Overview}

\section{Model Architecture}
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe Model Architecture
\item Describe different Components of Model Architecture
\item Describe different variants of the model (with/without pf, with/without embeddings)
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe Class Diagram
\item Describe prediction mode/training mode
\end{itemize}

\section{Production Setup}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe the flow of a recommendation through the system for the different cases
    \item Probably a sequence diagram makes most sense
    \item I.e. show how SOFI etc. plays into this whole thing
\end{itemize}
